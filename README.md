# Recipe Finder App Using Image Recognition

## Project Background

“Where can I find the recipe for this?”, “where did I put my cookbook?”, “is there no way to browse for recipes and save them without paying?”, “there’s no food around, should I just order food?”, “what can I make with these ingredients in my fridge?”, “what’s the recipe for this?”.

How many times have you heard someone say this? How many times have you thought of something like this? Some would answer never, and some would answer often, but for me personally I struggle with the same issue. Thus, why I steeled myself to simplify these processes and ease the burden of endlessly wondering what to eat through the development of this app.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **Backend Server**: Firebase
- **API**: Spoonacular

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- A MacBook
- Xcode installed

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Open the file in Xcode**
    - Navigate to the location of the project file and open it in Xcode.

2. **Make sure all the packages are done installing and everything is done processing before running**
    - Xcode will automatically start installing necessary packages and processing files. Wait for this to complete before proceeding.

3. **Run the file in a simulator or connect an iOS device**
    - You can run the application in an iOS simulator within Xcode, or connect an actual iOS device to your MacBook and select it as the target device in Xcode.

**Note:** Make sure to use a MacBook to run this.
